## About Emotino
**Emotino** is a platform designed to help users manage their emotions and improve emotional well-being in the workplace.  

- üéôÔ∏è AI-guided emotional sessions based on speech input
- üìä Personal emotional history tracking with session summaries
- üèÖ A gamified experience with badges, levels, and points
- üß† Tailored activity suggestions based on users' emotional state

Emotino is built as a full-stack web application, consisting of a **Vue.js** front-end for the user interface and a **Spring Boot** back-end that handles API logic, database interactions, and AI integration.  
The system uses **PostgreSQL** for data storage and leverages **OpenAI GPT-4** and a custom emotion recognition model to generate context-aware, emotionally sensitive responses.
